# 👋 Introduction

Welcome to **Formal Mind AI** — an agent-based system for **formal verification**, built to help developers reason rigorously about their code from the first commit to the final pull request.

## 🧠 What is Formal Mind?

Formal Mind is a GitHub App + Agent framework that:

- Watches your repositories
- Models your codebase with **Lean 4**
- Helps verify invariants, specs, and tests
- Comments directly on your PRs with suggestions or proofs

It's like having a formal methods research assistant who never sleeps and always checks edge cases.

---

## 🚫 What It’s *Not*

- It doesn't magically prove undecidable problems.
- It won’t replace your test suite (but it *will* complement it).
- It’s not limited to smart contracts — though it loves them deeply.

---

## 🔍 Who Is This For?

- Developers building critical systems
- Researchers using theorem provers in real-world pipelines
- Hackers who want to fuse AI + proof automation
- Anyone curious about **automated reasoning** and GitHub-integrated verification

> [!TIP]
> Formal verification doesn’t have to be painful. Formal Mind makes it feel like pair programming with a very nerdy, very helpful friend.
