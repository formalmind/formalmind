# 🧪 Agent Exploration Modes

| Mode Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **@agent verify** ✅ | Triggers the verification workflow and builds a Lean repo from a template |
| **Agent Summon Tags** *(soon)* | Use `@agent model`, or `@agent explain` to direct intent |
| **Push Review Mode** ✅ | Reacts to every push on `main`, offering feedback, specs, and goals |
| **PR Modeling Mode** ✅ | Reads your pull request diff and responds with Lean IR and invariants |
| **HK Exploration Mode (planned)** | (*Historical Knowledge*) Walks through your repo’s Git history, building symbolic understanding step by step |
| **Nested Logic Exploration (planned)** | Handles modular or deeply nested logic like `src/utils/math/graph.ts` |
| **Timewalk Debugging** *(planned)* | Trace how proofs change over time, diffing spec vs. implementation |
| **Spec Composer** *(planned)* | Allows you to write higher-level specs and maps them to code blocks |

## 👷🏽‍♀️ What Would *You* Like To See?

We’re building with developers like you in the loop. What kind of agent behaviors or exploration modes would **you** find useful?

- Verifying zk circuits?
- Composing agents into multi-step planners?
- Connecting Lean proofs with GitHub Copilot comments?

> [!TIP]
> File an issue, or just drop a comment in your PR with `@agent idea: <your suggestion>` — we’re watching 👀
